    <h2>Why did we make this app?</h2>
    <p>We as developers made an idea of having a social media app that would be like peer to peer/ hearsay that is the reason for the code before getting 
        to interact with the app. Then after we loved the idea of having random anonymous account given to you and you are given categories to choose from after that you click of said 
        categories that would give you current events, and in that you can have discussion at that time period with somebody else, We love the idea of bringing random people together give each other there takes on current events they are interested in.</p>
